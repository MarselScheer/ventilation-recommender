* ventilation-recommender

RPi monitors humidity and recommends ventilation via pushbullet

* RPi

- OS: Raspbian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)

* Development

- `make build/start-docker-ide`. no stop needed stops when leaving the container

* iac
- §§iac;;f: docker container for development build and started via make targets
- §§iac;;f: token passed to docker container via environment variable
- §§iac;;f: systemd service uses environment file to start docker container with necessary token
** shortcomings
- §§iac;;s||C==2__0: have docker folder instead of iac and maybe also use docker compose
* dashboard
** shortcomings
- §§dashboard;;s||D==4__0: Overview of the all measurements over time
* core logic
- §§core;;f: Within development fake sensor and pushbulletk
- §§core;;f: Log to /tmp/monitor.log in the docker container
** shortcomings
- §§core;;s||C==2__0: logs accessible outside docker container
- §§core;;s||D==2__0: script needs arguments for humidity threshold and time between two notifications
* documentation
** shortcomings
- §§docu;;s||E==3__0: document how to deploy to RPi
- §§docu;;s||D==3__0: docstrings
