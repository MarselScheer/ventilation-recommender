* ventilation-recommender

RPi monitors humidity and recommends ventilation via pushbullet

* RPi

- OS: Raspbian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)

* Development

- `make build/start-docker-ide`. no stop needed stops when leaving the container

* Deployment measurement

1. mkdir repos && cd repos && git clone https://github.com/MarselScheer/ventilation-recommender.git
2. cp PUSHBULLET_TOKEN-template PUSHBULLET_TOKEN
3. add the token to PUSHBULLET_TOKEN
4. cp iac/host/ventilation.service /etc/systemd/system/
5. maybe update "EnvironmentFile" field in /etc/systemd/system/ventilation.service to point the file with the token
6. systemctl enable ventilation.service
7. make app-build
8. systemctl start ventilation.service
9. a pushbullet message should appear informing about the threshold used for sending an alarm


* iac
- §§iac;;f: docker container for development build and started via make targets
- §§iac;;f: token passed to docker container via environment variable
- §§iac;;f: data stored on host and mounted into docker-container for mearsurement and dashboard
- §§iac;;f: systemd service uses environment file to start docker container with necessary token
** shortcomings
- §§iac;;s||C==2__0: have docker folder instead of iac and maybe also use docker compose
- §§iac;;s||B==3__0: make targets to deploy app
- §§iac;;s||C==1__0: ide should have user ide instead of docker (unifies it with other docker images; also adapt mounts during start)
* dashboard
** shortcomings
- §§dashboard;;s||D==4__0: Overview of the all measurements over time
* core logic
- §§core;;f: Within development fake sensor and pushbulletk
- §§core;;f: Log to /tmp/monitor.log in the docker container
** shortcomings
- §§core;;s||C==2__0: logs accessible outside docker container
- §§core;;s||D==2__0: script needs arguments for humidity threshold and time between two notifications
* documentation
** shortcomings
- §§docu;;s||D==3__0: docstrings
