* ventilation-recommender

RPi monitors humidity and recommends ventilation via pushbullet

* RPi

- OS: Raspbian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)

* Development

** Measurement
- `make build/start-docker-ide`. no stop needed stops when leaving the container

** Dashboard
- `make run-dashboard-in-dev-mode` this starts the dashboard directly (not in a docker container). On host visit 127.0.0.1:8000

* Deployment measurement

1. mkdir repos && cd repos && git clone https://github.com/MarselScheer/ventilation-recommender.git
2. cp PUSHBULLET_TOKEN-template PUSHBULLET_TOKEN
3. add the token to PUSHBULLET_TOKEN
4. cp iac/host/ventilation.service /etc/systemd/system/
5. maybe update "EnvironmentFile" field in /etc/systemd/system/ventilation.service to point the file with the token
6. systemctl enable ventilation.service
7. make app-build
8. systemctl start ventilation.service
9. a pushbullet message should appear informing about the threshold used for sending an alarm


* iac
- §§iac;;f: docker container for development build and started via make targets
- §§iac;;f: token passed to docker container via environment variable
- §§iac;;f: data stored on host and mounted into docker-container for mearsurement and dashboard
- §§iac;;f: systemd service uses environment file to start docker container with necessary token
- §§iac;;f: docker image for dashboard is build via ci-pipeline on github (because it must be build for arm architecture)

** shortcomings
- §§iac;;s||C==2__0: have docker folder instead of iac and maybe also use docker compose
- §§iac;;s||B==3__0: make targets to deploy app
- §§iac;;s||C==1__0: ide should have user ide instead of docker (unifies it with other docker images; also adapt mounts during start)
- §§iac;;s||C==3__0: PR take ages because building the dashboard image is super slow (a shiny_arm base image might be helpful)
* dashboard
- §§dashboard;;f: shows humidity and temperature in one plot with 2 y-axes
- §§dashboard;;f: loads data from /data folder on the host system mounted to /data
** shortcomings
- None
* core logic
- §§core;;f: Within development fake sensor and pushbullet
- §§core;;f: Sends pushbullet message when threshold is exceeded but only between 8 and 22 o'clock and if the last notification is was at least 30 before
- §§core;;f: writes measurements to /data folder on the host system mounted to /data
- §§core;;f: Log to /tmp/monitor.log in the docker container
** shortcomings
- §§core;;s||B==2__0: logs accessible outside docker container
- §§core;;s||D==2__0: script needs arguments for humidity threshold and time between two notifications
