* ventilation-recommender

RPi monitors humidity and recommends ventilation via pushbullet

* RPi

- OS: Raspbian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)

* Development

- `make build/start-docker-ide`. no stop needed stops when leaving the container

* iac
- §§iac;;f: docker container for development build and started via make targets

** shortcomings
- §§iac;;s||E==2__0: token baked into docker image
- §§iac;;s||C==2__0: have docker folder instead of iac and maybe also use docker compose
- §§iac;;s||D==2__0: systemd service file is not part of the repo
* dashboard
** shortcomings
- §§dashboard;;s||D==4__0: Overview of the all measurements over time
* core logic
- §§core;;f: Within development fake sensor and pushbulletk
** shortcomings
- §§core;;s||D==2__0: no logging
- §§core;;s||D==2__0: script needs arguments for humidity threshold and time between two notifications
* documentation
** shortcomings
- §§docu;;s||E==3__0: nearly no documentation
